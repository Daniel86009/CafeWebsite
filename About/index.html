    <h3>Our Rich History</h3>
    <p>The cafe was established in 2025 by a group of budding entrepreneurs who collaborated to create greatness. Our beloved chef John Dough has shared our passion and experience and has supported us through the highs and lows of the company. We have also had a close relation with our local coffee bean farmers as seen above which are locally sourced from Western Africa. One of our key ideas would be supporting the local coffee bean business, now whenever you purchase from our cafe you are supporting the kind local farmers like James, John and the children that work under their careful watch.</p>
